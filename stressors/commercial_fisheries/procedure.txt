After email correspondance with Josh Keaton from NOAA in Alaska, it is clear that there is no trawling (bottom or mid-water) in our region. In addition, there are no groundfish fisheries. The only fisheries that exist in this region are crab and salmon fisheries. 

Both Crab and Salmon fisheries are regulated by the state of Alaska (Alaska Department of Fish and Game). 

Salmon fisheries are limited to state waters but crab fisheries are not.

Changes to US EEZ fishing:

- no demersal destructive fishing
- no demersal non-destructive, high bycatch fishing
- no pelagic, high bycatch fishing
- no pelagic, lowbycatch fishing in federal waters (salmon fisheries in state waters)
- there is demersal, non-destructive, lowbycatch fishing in federal and state waters (Crab)

Update RUS EEZ fishing:
- there is no better Russian EEZ fisheries data, so I have kept same values from Global 2013 (using the fishprod data layer which is the catch rate/productivity).

CLIPPING CHI 2013 LAYERS

For each commercial fisheries layer, the layer used in 2013 cumulative impact analyses was clipped manually in ArcGIS to the bering_boundaries_shoreline_lea polygon - checked box 'Use Input Features for Clipping Geometry'

These original data layers are found: H:\mnt\storage\marine_threats\impact_layers_2013_redo\impact_layers\final_impact_layers\threats_2013_interim\new_layers.

the clipped layers are saved in 'A:\HIACMS\CHI\bering-strait\stressors\commercial_fisheries\working'
